## Purdue Buildings (got 1st place as a team in 2019 Purdue Helloworld Hackathon)
- This is an iOS version of the program that our team had created for HelloWorld 2019.
- This program prompts users to input the room number of closest classroom they see(ex 1304) and destination(ex 3042).
It can guide users from a specific floor to another floor and even to the closest exit in case of emergency. 
- This program utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm in order to display the shortest path.
